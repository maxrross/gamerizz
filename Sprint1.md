## User stories:
  
  As a first time user, I want a friendly login screen so that I am welcomed to the site and want to stay on it.
  
  As a returning user, I want a visually distinct site so that I know that I am at the right site.
  
  As a frequent user, I want a way to remember my login so that I do not have to sign in every time.
  
  As a new user, I want a easy to follow sign in page so that it is simply to set up my account and I do not have to struggle to actually get what I want.
  
  As a site memeber, I want an informational but clean homepage so that I can get the information I want without be bombarded with other distractions.
  
  As a site visitor, I want a friends page so that I can see what my friends are rating without seeing anyone else's ratings.
  
  As an older memeber, I want old reviews to be available so that I can access things from the past and dig up things that I remember.
  
  As a new member, I want help setting up my account so that I can get a jumpstart on the site without starting at the complete start with nothing.

## What issues your team planned to address:
  We planned to address setting up our MongoDB databas, setting up our backend endpoint for seeing if the user is authenticated, creating login and sign up user interface, making the login
  virtually pleasing, and creating our Sprint1.md for submission.

## Which ones were successfully completed:
  The frontend team successfully created a login and homepage user interface. We added a responsive navbar with mobile view and login/signup authentication with Auth0. 

The backend team was able to setup the MongoDB database and connect it to our code in Go. We also were able create an enpoint that connected to Auth0 to see if a user's JST token is valid.

## Which ones didn't and why:
  We did not have any problems and completed everything.
